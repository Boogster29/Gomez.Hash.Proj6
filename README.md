Project 6 report

	It appears that your usage of either a hash tables, B-trees, or 2-3-4 Trees all depend upon what you are needing it for and the 
  nature of requirements. Using the hash tables seem to be quick finding and if timeliness is needed, then this one would be the way to go. 
  This offers a quicker way to find data but not so much for organization. The other two methods are best for sorting data in order.
  I am not greatly familiar with all of these methods but B-tree seems to be a little easier than 2-3-4 trees in how the code is generated.
	Less work and just as good output is a good way to go, I think. They all have their strengths about them that make each useful to the 
  programmer. They all seem to be a pain in the behind to me since this is my first experience with them all. These methods are something 
  that needs to be practiced well to be proficient in. Depending on the situation, each one would be a good fit and be useful. 
	It is difficult to say which one is best but doing less work is not always best. A program is useful if it works best for the project. 
  So, depending on the level of complexity, I would probably go for either a 2-3-4 tree or hash table. 2-3-4 tree is better but may incur 
  additional costs unlike the hash. Not enough experience to give conclusive answer.
